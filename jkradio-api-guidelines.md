## Introduction

### Purpose

This document provides comprehensive guidelines and standards for developing, securing, and
publishing APIs within the JK Radio organization. These guidelines ensure consistency, security, and
usability across all JK Radio APIs, while promoting an API-first approach to development. Adherence
to these standards will enable JK Radio to build a robust, interoperable digital ecosystem that
supports our business objectives and enhances our services to both internal and external
stakeholders.

### Why APIs Matter at JK Radio

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) form the foundation of our modern digital ecosystem. They
provide an efficient and controlled way to make data and services accessible across systems. By
developing standardized APIs, JK Radio:

- Enables seamless integration between internal systems
- Facilitates secure data sharing with partners and the public
- Creates opportunities for innovation through third-party development
- Reduces development time and costs for new features and services
- Supports a unified customer experience across platforms

APIs are not merely technical implementations but strategic business assets that support our
organization's mission to deliver high-quality radio services and content to our audience.

### Principles

- **API-First Design**: Design APIs before implementation, focusing on the consumer experience and
  use cases rather than backend data structures. This ensures APIs meet actual business needs.
- **Consistency**: API interfaces should follow consistent patterns across the organization to
  reduce the learning curve for developers and facilitate faster integration.
- **Security by Design**: Security must be embedded from the start, not added as an afterthought.
  Every API should be designed with appropriate authentication, authorization, and data protection
  mechanisms.
- **Documentation Driven**: Comprehensive documentation should be maintained throughout the API
  lifecycle, making APIs discoverable and easy to use.
- **Consumer Focus**: APIs should be designed with the consumer's needs in mind, prioritizing
  developer experience and usability.
- **Reusability**: Design APIs to be reusable across multiple contexts and applications rather than
  for single use cases.
- **Open Standards**: Prefer industry-accepted open standards and avoid proprietary protocols and
  data schemas when possible.
- **Iterative Evolution**: Design APIs to enable iterations as new requirements emerge, while
  maintaining reasonable backward compatibility.

### Benefits of API-First Approach

- **Improved developer experience**: Well-designed APIs with clear documentation lead to faster
  onboarding and fewer support requests.
- **Faster integration time**: Consistent patterns and standards reduce the effort required to
  integrate with new APIs.
- **Reduced development costs**: Reusable interfaces eliminate the need to build custom integrations
  for each new system.
- **Consistent interfaces across the organization**: A unified approach to API design creates a
  cohesive experience across all JK Radio systems.
- **Easier maintenance and evolution**: Following API lifecycle best practices makes it easier to
  evolve APIs over time with minimal disruption.
- **Enhanced innovation**: Open APIs allow for creative applications and use cases beyond what was
  originally envisioned.
- **Increased agility**: Well-designed APIs enable teams to work independently at their own pace.
- **Better testing and quality assurance**: API-first design facilitates comprehensive testing
  strategies including automated testing.

### API Governance at JK Radio

The API governance model at JK Radio ensures that all APIs adhere to these guidelines and meet our
quality standards. The governance process includes:

1. **Design Review**: All new API designs are reviewed against these guidelines before
   implementation
2. **Security Assessment**: Security reviews are conducted for all APIs, with more rigorous reviews
   for those handling sensitive data
3. **Documentation Standards**: All APIs must meet documentation requirements before release
4. **Lifecycle Management**: Clear processes for versioning, deprecation, and retirement of APIs
5. **Monitoring and Metrics**: All APIs are monitored for performance, usage, and errors

This governance approach balances the need for consistency and security with the agility required
for innovation and business responsiveness.

## API Design Standards

### RESTful API Design

JK Radio APIs should adhere to RESTful principles to ensure consistency, scalability, and ease of
use. The following standards and best practices should be followed when designing RESTful APIs:

#### Design Principles

- **Simplicity and Reusability**: Design APIs to be the best way for clients to consume your data
- **Consistency**: Create APIs with a common look and feel using consistent style and syntax
- **Security by Design**: Make security inherent in API development, not an afterthought
- **Continuous Improvement**: Actively enhance APIs based on consumer feedback
- **Sustainability**: Avoid short-term optimizations at the expense of client-side obligations
- **Quality**: Ensure flexibility and scalability while presenting actionable data to consumers
- **Well Described**: Use consistent, simple API specifications and endpoint naming standards
- **Open Standards Based**: Follow standard HTTP methods, status codes, and error responses

#### Resource-Oriented Design

- **Design Around Resources**: APIs should be organized around resources (nouns) rather than
  actions. Resources represent entities or collections that consumers can manipulate through the
  API.
- **Resource Naming**: Use clear, descriptive nouns in plural form for resources:

  - Good: `/stations`, `/podcasts`, `/episodes`
  - Avoid: `/getStations`, `/createPodcast`, `/stationData`

- **Resource Hierarchy**: Represent relationships through resource hierarchy:
  - Parent-child relationships: `/stations/{stationId}/programs`
  - Use sub-collections when appropriate: `/users/{userId}/favorites`

#### Uniform Interface

- **HTTP Methods**: Use HTTP methods appropriately to perform operations on resources:

  - `GET`: Retrieve resources (read-only operations)
  - `POST`: Create new resources
  - `PUT`: Replace/update entire resources
  - `PATCH`: Partial update of resources
  - `DELETE`: Remove resources

- **Idempotent Operations**: Ensure that `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and `HEAD` requests are idempotent
  (multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request).

- **Safe Operations**: `GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS` should be safe (read-only with no side effects).

#### Statelessness

- **No Client State on Server**: Each request from client to server must contain all information  
  needed to understand and process the request. Server should not store client state between
  requests.

- **Session State**: When needed, session state should be managed via tokens (e.g., JWT) passed in  
  request headers, not server-side sessions.

#### API Responses

- **Resource Representations**: Responses should include representations of resources, typically in
  JSON.

- **Standardized Response Format**: Use JSON as the default message structure for all APIs

  - Form responses as a JSON object, not an array
  - Use consistent grammar case (either snake_case or camelCase)
  - JK Radio standardizes on camelCase for JSON property names

- **Hypermedia Links (HATEOAS)**: Where appropriate, include links in responses that enable
  clients  
  to discover related resources and available actions:

  ```json
  {
    "stationId": "kjr1",
    "name": "JK Radio One",
    "links": [
      { "rel": "programs", "href": "/stations/kjr1/programs" },
      { "rel": "schedule", "href": "/stations/kjr1/schedule" }
    ]
  }
  ```

- **Consistent Response Structure**: Use consistent structures for both success and error responses.

#### Query Parameters

- **Filtering**: Use query parameters for filtering: `/programs?genre=news&duration=60`

- **Field Selection**: Support selecting specific fields:
  `/stations?fields=name,frequency,streamUrl`

- **Not for Actions**: Avoid using query parameters for actions; use appropriate HTTP methods
  instead.

- **Pagination**: For large datasets, implement pagination using one of these patterns:
  - `page` and `perPage` – best for navigating large static datasets
  - `offset` and `limit` – best for SQL-based backends
  - `since` and `limit` – best for time-based delta queries

#### Best Practices

- **Use Plural Nouns**: Prefer plural resource names (`/stations` not `/station`) for consistency.

- **Avoid Verbs in URLs**: Use HTTP methods for verbs, not URL paths.

  - Avoid: `/getStations`, `/createProgram`
  - Prefer: `GET /stations`, `POST /programs`

- **Consistent Casing**: Use `kebab-case` for URL paths and `camelCase` for query parameters.

- **Version in URL Path**: Include API version in the URL path: `/v1/stations`

- **Resource IDs**: Use meaningful, stable identifiers. UUIDs are preferred for new resources
  where  
  human-readability is not required.

- **Predictable Resource URLs**: Resource URLs should be predictable and follow consistent patterns.

- **Always Use HTTPS**: Secure all API communications with HTTPS, regardless of data classification.

- **Don't Expose Sensitive Data in URLs**: Use JSON payload for queries with sensitive data.

- **Standardized Error Codes**: Use standard HTTP status codes for errors, avoid custom error
  schemes. A quality error response should include:

  1. HTTP Status Code
  2. Internal reference ID mapped to documentation
  3. Human-readable message summarizing context, cause, and solution

- **Abstract Internal Details**: Responses should hide internal technical details like stack traces.

These standards ensure JK Radio APIs conform to industry best practices while maintaining
consistency across our API ecosystem. Teams should reference this section when designing new APIs or
updating existing ones.

### JSON Structure and Format

JK Radio APIs should use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) as the default format for request and  
response payloads. Following these guidelines ensures consistency, readability, and
interoperability  
across all APIs:

#### JSON as the Default Format

- **Use JSON for All APIs**: JSON should be the default and primary format for all API requests and
  responses
- **Always Set Content-Type**: Include `Content-Type: application/json` in response headers
- **Support Content Negotiation**: Use the `Accept` header to determine the response format
- **UTF-8 Encoding**: Always use UTF-8 encoding for JSON data

#### Object Structure

- **Root Element**: The response should be a JSON object (not an array) to allow for future
  expansion

  - Good: `{"stations": [{"id": "kjr1", "name": "JK Radio One"}]}`
  - Avoid: `[{"id": "kjr1", "name": "JK Radio One"}]`

- **Nested Resources**: Use nested objects to represent related resources when appropriate:

  ```json
  {
    "program": {
      "id": "morning-show",
      "title": "Morning Show",
      "host": {
        "id": "host-1",
        "name": "Jane Smith"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **Collections**: Represent collections as arrays with descriptive wrapper properties:

  ```json
  {
    "stations": [
      { "id": "kjr1", "name": "JK Radio One" },
      { "id": "kjr2", "name": "JK Radio Two" }
    ],
    "total": 2,
    "page": 1,
    "perPage": 10
  }
  ```

#### Naming Conventions

- **Consistent Case**: Use camelCase for all property names in JSON responses

  - Example: `{"stationId": "kjr1", "broadcastFrequency": 98.5}`

- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive property names that convey meaning

  - Good: `{"createdAt": "2025-05-26T14:30:00Z"}`
  - Avoid: `{"ct": "2025-05-26T14:30:00Z"}`

- **Boolean Naming**: Use positive phrasing for boolean properties with "is", "has", or "can"
  prefixes

  - Example: `{"isLive": true, "hasSubscribers": false, "canStream": true}`

- **Consistent Pluralization**: Use singular for single items and plural for collections

#### Data Types and Formats

- **Use Appropriate Types**: Use the correct JSON data types for each value:

  - Strings: For text and formatted data (`"text"`)
  - Numbers: For numeric values without quotes (`42`, `98.5`)
  - Booleans: For true/false values without quotes (`true`, `false`)
  - Objects: For complex, structured data (`{}`)
  - Arrays: For collections of similar items (`[]`)
  - Null: For intentionally empty values (`null`)

- **Standard Date/Time Format**: Use ISO 8601 format for all date and time values

  - UTC timestamps: `"2025-05-26T14:30:00Z"`
  - Date only: `"2025-05-26"`
  - Time only: `"14:30:00"`

- **Consistent Units**: Document and use consistent units of measurement

  - Include the unit in the property name when helpful: `durationSeconds`, `sizeBytes`

- **Standard Formats for Common Data Types**:
  - URLs: Full URLs including protocol (`"https://api.jkradio.com/stations"`)
  - Email addresses: Standard format (`"contact@jkradio.com"`)
  - Phone numbers: E.164 format (`"+12025550179"`)
  - Currency: ISO 4217 code with numeric value (`{"currency": "USD", "amount": 19.99}`)

#### Best Practices

- **Minimize Nesting**: Keep the JSON structure as flat as practical while still representing
  relationships
- **Consistent Structure**: Use consistent response structures across all endpoints
- **Avoid Empty Fields**: Omit properties with null or empty values unless they are significant
- **Schema Validation**: Validate response data against JSON Schema for critical endpoints
- **Response Size**: Balance completeness with response size; use pagination for large collections
- **No Comments**: JSON doesn't support comments; use descriptive property names instead

These JSON structure and format guidelines ensure that JK Radio APIs provide a consistent and
intuitive experience for all consumers, while facilitating easier integration and maintenance.

### URL Conventions

Standards for URL structure, resource naming, and endpoint design are critical for creating
intuitive, discoverable APIs. JK Radio APIs should follow these URL structure guidelines:

#### URI Structure

- **Standard Endpoint Format**: Follow this pattern for all API endpoints:  
  `https://<base domain>/<api version>/<business function>/<resource>`

  Example: `https://api.jkradio.com/v1/media/stations`

- **Base Domains**: Use consistent base domains for different types of APIs:

  - Public APIs: `https://api.jkradio.com`
  - Partner APIs: `https://partner-api.jkradio.com`
  - Internal APIs: `https://internal-api.jkradio.com`

- **Resource Path Structure**: Structure resource paths logically with these guidelines:
  - Use plural nouns for resources: `/stations`, `/episodes`, `/programs`
  - Use kebab-case for multi-word resources: `/podcast-episodes`, `/live-streams`
  - Use hierarchical relationships for related resources: `/stations/{stationId}/programs`
  - Keep URLs clean and meaningful: no trailing slashes, no file extensions
- **Query Parameters**: Use consistent naming and behavior for common query parameters:
  - Filtering: `?type=news&genre=talk`
  - Pagination: `?page=2&perPage=20` or `?offset=40&limit=20`
  - Field selection: `?fields=id,name,frequency`
  - Sorting: `?sort=publishDate` or `?sort=-publishDate` (descending)
  - Search: `?q=morning+show`

#### URI Versioning

- **Version in Path**: Include the API major version number in the URI path:  
  `https://api.jkradio.com/v1/stations`

- **Base URI for Latest Version**: The base URI without a version should route to the latest stable
  version:  
  `https://api.jkradio.com/stations` → routes to latest version

#### Resource Naming Conventions

- **Resource Names**: Use plural, noun-based names that clearly identify the resource

  - Good: `/stations`, `/episodes`, `/programs`, `/playlists`
  - Avoid: `/station`, `/getEpisodes`, `/programData`

- **Subresources**: When resources are related, represent this with nested paths:

  - `/stations/{stationId}/programs`
  - `/programs/{programId}/episodes`
  - `/users/{userId}/favorites`

- **Actions on Resources**: For operations that don't fit the standard CRUD model, use a
  resource-action pattern:
  - `POST /stations/{stationId}/broadcasts/start`
  - `POST /programs/{programId}/schedule`

#### Best Practices

- **Keep URLs Readable**: URIs should be easy to read and construct manually
- **Consistency**: Follow the same patterns across all APIs
- **Stability**: Once published, resource URLs should not change
- **Avoid Query String for Resource IDs**: Put resource IDs in the path, not query string
- **ASCII Only**: Use only ASCII characters in URLs; encode all other characters
- **Case Sensitivity**: Treat URLs as case-sensitive (though kebab-case minimizes case issues)
- **No Sensitive Data**: Never include sensitive data in URLs

Following these URI conventions will ensure JK Radio APIs are consistent, predictable, and easy to
use for developers, while promoting good API design practices that align with industry standards.

### HTTP Methods

JK Radio APIs should support and correctly implement HTTP methods as defined in RFC 7231 and
RFC 5789. Each method should be used according to its intended semantic meaning to ensure that our
APIs remain consistent, intuitive, and compliant with web standards. Follow the properties of each
method according  
to these RFCs to maintain proper behavior and expectations.

#### Primary HTTP Methods

- **GET**: Retrieve a representation of a resource without modifying it

  - Must be safe (no side effects) and idempotent (same result regardless of how many times
    executed)
  - Example: `GET /stations/kjr1` retrieves information about station KJR1
  - Cannot contain a request body
  - Can be cached when appropriate cache headers are included
  - Should never be used for operations that change state

- **POST**: Create a new resource or submit data for processing

  - Not idempotent - multiple identical requests may create multiple resources
  - Example: `POST /stations` creates a new station
  - Typically includes a request body with the data for the new resource
  - Response should include the location of the new resource via the `Location` header
  - Returns 201 (Created) when a resource is created or 200 (OK) for other successful operations

- **PUT**: Replace an existing resource or create it if it doesn't exist

  - Must be idempotent - multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request
  - Example: `PUT /stations/kjr1` replaces the entire station resource
  - Requires the full representation of the resource
  - Returns 200 (OK) if resource was updated, 201 (Created) if created

- **PATCH**: Apply partial modifications to a resource

  - As defined in RFC 5789
  - Example: `PATCH /stations/kjr1` updates specific fields of the station resource
  - Request body contains instructions on how to modify the resource
  - Not required to be idempotent, but should be designed to be when possible
  - Returns 200 (OK) if resource was updated, 204 (No Content) if successful with no response body

- **DELETE**: Remove a resource
  - Must be idempotent - deleting a resource multiple times has the same effect
  - Example: `DELETE /stations/kjr1` removes the station resource
  - Returns 200 (OK) if successful with response body, 204 (No Content) if successful with no body,
    or 404 (Not Found) if resource doesn't exist

#### Additional HTTP Methods

- **HEAD**: Identical to GET but returns only HTTP headers without the response body

  - Must be safe and idempotent
  - Example: `HEAD /stations/kjr1` retrieves headers for the station resource
  - Useful for checking if a resource exists or has been modified
  - Must return the same headers as the equivalent GET request

- **OPTIONS**: Describes the communication options for the target resource

  - Must be safe and idempotent
  - Example: `OPTIONS /stations` returns allowed methods on the stations collection
  - Used for CORS pre-flight requests
  - Should return an `Allow` header listing supported methods

- **CONNECT**: Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource

  - Not typically used in RESTful APIs
  - Reserved for use with a proxy

- **TRACE**: Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource
  - Not recommended for use in JK Radio APIs due to security concerns
  - Should be disabled in production environments

#### Method Requirements and Constraints

1. **Consistency**: Use HTTP methods consistently across all APIs
2. **Idempotency**: Maintain proper idempotency for methods that require it
3. **Safe Methods**: Never use safe methods (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS) for state-changing operations
4. **Method Overloading**: Don't use query parameters or headers to override the standard behavior
   of a method
5. **Method Not Allowed**: Return 405 (Method Not Allowed) with an `Allow` header when a method is
   not supported
6. **Method Support**: All resources must support GET and OPTIONS methods, other methods are
   optional
7. **All Collections**: Collections should support GET and usually POST for creating new items

#### HTTP Method Properties

The following table summarizes the key properties of HTTP methods as defined in RFC 7231 and RFC
5789:

| **Method** | **Safe** | **Idempotent** | **Cacheable** |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| GET        | Yes      | Yes            | Yes           |
| HEAD       | Yes      | Yes            | Yes           |
| POST       | No       | No\*           | Rarely\*\*    |
| PUT        | No       | Yes            | No            |
| PATCH      | No       | No\*           | No            |
| DELETE     | No       | Yes            | No            |
| OPTIONS    | Yes      | Yes            | No            |
| TRACE      | Yes      | Yes            | No            |

\* _While not required by the standards, it's recommended to design POST and PATCH operations to be
idempotent when possible, such as by using client-generated IDs or handling duplicate submissions
gracefully._

\*\* _POST can be cacheable only under specific conditions when the response includes explicit
freshness  
information. This is rarely implemented._

#### Method Selection Guidelines

| If you want to...                                       | Use this method |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Retrieve a resource                                     | GET             |
| Create a resource with a server-generated ID            | POST            |
| Create or replace a resource with a client-specified ID | PUT             |
| Update part of an existing resource                     | PATCH           |
| Remove a resource                                       | DELETE          |
| Check if a resource exists or has been modified         | HEAD            |
| Find out which operations are supported                 | OPTIONS         |

#### Content Negotiation

When using methods that send or receive data (POST, PUT, PATCH), follow these guidelines:

- Set the `Content-Type` header to indicate the format of the request body
- Use the `Accept` header to specify the desired response format
- Support at minimum `application/json` for both request and response bodies
- Consider supporting additional formats like `application/xml` when needed by consumers

These guidelines ensure JK Radio APIs follow standard RESTful practices while maintaining  
consistency across our API ecosystem. Teams should reference this section when implementing  
the HTTP layer of their APIs.

### HTTP Status Codes

JK Radio APIs should use standardized HTTP status codes as defined in RFC 7231 to indicate the  
success or failure of API requests. Using consistent status codes helps API consumers understand  
and handle responses appropriately.

#### Status Code Categories

- **1xx: Informational** - The request was received and is being processed
- **2xx: Success** - The request was successfully processed
- **3xx: Redirection** - Further action needs to be taken to complete the request
- **4xx: Client Error** - The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
- **5xx: Server Error** - The server failed to fulfill a valid request

#### Common Status Codes and Their Usage

| Code | Status          | Description                      | When to Use                              |
| ---- | --------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 200  | OK              | Request succeeded                | Successful GET/update with response      |
| 201  | Created         | Resource created                 | Successful creation via POST             |
| 202  | Accepted        | Request accepted for processing  | Async operations, batch processing       |
| 204  | No Content      | Success with no content          | DELETE/update with empty response        |
| 304  | Not Modified    | Resource not modified            | Conditional GET with matching conditions |
| 400  | Bad Request     | Malformed/invalid request        | Missing params, validation errors        |
| 401  | Unauthorized    | Authentication missing/failed    | Missing or invalid credentials           |
| 403  | Forbidden       | Authentication OK, access denied | User lacks necessary permissions         |
| 404  | Not Found       | Resource doesn't exist           | Resource not found or hidden             |
| 405  | Not Allowed     | Method not allowed for resource  | Unsupported method for resource          |
| 409  | Conflict        | Request conflicts with state     | Edit conflicts, duplicate values         |
| 415  | Unsupported     | Unsupported media type           | Unsupported content type                 |
| 422  | Unprocessable   | Invalid semantics                | Complex validation errors                |
| 429  | Too Many        | Too many requests                | Rate limit exceeded                      |
| 500  | Server Error    | Generic server error             | Unexpected server-side error             |
| 501  | Not Implemented | Functionality not supported      | Endpoint or method not implemented       |
| 503  | Unavailable     | Temporarily unavailable          | Maintenance or overload                  |

#### Response Bodies with Status Codes

- **2xx responses** should include:

  - For GET: the requested resource(s)
  - For POST: the created resource or confirmation
  - For PUT/PATCH: the updated resource or confirmation
  - For DELETE: no body or confirmation message

- **4xx/5xx responses** should include:
  - Clear error message
  - Error code or identifier
  - Additional context to help troubleshoot
  - Link to relevant documentation when applicable

#### Status Code Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Use the most specific status code that applies to the situation
2. **Consistent Usage**: Use status codes consistently across all APIs
3. **Error Details**: Provide detailed error information in the response body for 4xx and 5xx
   responses
4. **Don't Invent Codes**: Stick to standard HTTP status codes rather than creating custom ones
5. **Redirect Carefully**: When using 3xx codes, include appropriate Location headers
6. **Include Allow Header**: With 405 responses, include an Allow header specifying valid methods

By following these status code guidelines, JK Radio APIs will provide clear and consistent responses
that clients can reliably interpret, improving usability and reducing integration issues.

### Versioning

API versioning is critical for maintaining backward compatibility while allowing your APIs to
evolve. JK Radio APIs should follow these versioning guidelines:

#### Versioning Strategy

- **Semantic Versioning Pattern**: Follow the `v<Major>.<Minor>.<Patch>` versioning structure:

  - _Major_: Breaking changes that are not backward compatible (e.g., removing fields, changing
    field types)
  - _Minor_: Backward compatible additions (e.g., adding new fields or endpoints)
  - _Patch_: Bug fixes and minor changes that don't affect the API contract

- **API Contract**: The API contract includes:
  - Resource structure and data types
  - Available endpoints and HTTP methods
  - Request and response formats
  - Authentication mechanisms
  - Rate limits and usage terms

#### Version in URI Path

- **Major Version in URI**: Include the major version number in the URI path:

  ```http
  https://api.jkradio.com/v1/stations
  ```

- **Latest Version**: The base URI without a version should route to the latest stable version:

  ```http
  https://api.jkradio.com/stations → routes to latest version
  ```

#### Accept Header Versioning

Accept header versioning is an alternative approach that may be appropriate in some situations:

```http
GET https://api.jkradio.com/stations
Accept: application/json;version=1.2.0
```

Guidelines for Accept header versioning:

- Recommended for machine-to-machine interfaces
- Useful for non-breaking changes (minor/patch)
- Maintains a single consistent URI for an API

#### Maintaining Compatibility

- **Support Previous Versions**: Support at least one previous major version (N-1) to ensure
  consuming  
  systems have time to migrate to the latest version.
- **Deprecation Policy**: Set and publish a clear deprecation timeline for each API version:

  - Announce deprecation at least 6 months before end-of-support
  - Include deprecation notices in API responses using the `Deprecation` and `Sunset` HTTP headers
  - Provide migration guides and support for transitioning to newer versions

- **Testing**: Ensure adequate testing on all minor and major releases:
  - Regression tests to verify backward compatibility
  - Integration tests with sample client applications
  - Performance and load testing to verify consistent behavior

#### Version Lifecycle Management

API versions should follow a clear lifecycle:

1. **Development**: Initial development phase, with potential breaking changes
2. **Beta**: Stabilizing phase with limited availability to selected partners
3. **Production**: Stable version available to all consumers with full support
4. **Deprecated**: End-of-life announced, but API still operational
5. **Sunset**: API version no longer available

Each API version should clearly indicate its current lifecycle stage in documentation and metadata.

### Pagination

APIs exposing resources that return potentially large collections should implement pagination to:

- Improve performance and response times
- Reduce server load and network traffic
- Enhance user experience with manageable data chunks

JK Radio APIs should implement one of the following standardized pagination approaches based on the
use case and backend architecture.

#### Pagination Patterns

JK Radio APIs should support one of these three pagination patterns:

1. **Page-Based Pagination**

   Best for: Static datasets where the same data is returned given the same page reference over
   time.

   **Query Parameters:**

   - `page`: The page number to retrieve (1-based)
   - `perPage`: The number of items per page

   **Example:**

   ```http
   GET /v1/stations?page=2&perPage=10
   ```

   **Response Structure:**

   ```json
   {
     "stations": [ ... ],
     "pagination": {
       "page": 2,
       "perPage": 10,
       "totalPages": 5,
       "totalItems": 48
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Offset-Based Pagination**

   Best for: SQL-based backends where the offset represents the data cursor on a given indexed
   column.

   **Query Parameters:**

   - `offset`: Number of items to skip
   - `limit`: Maximum number of items to return

   **Example:**

   ```http
   GET /v1/programs?offset=20&limit=10
   ```

   **Response Structure:**

   ```json
   {
     "programs": [ ... ],
     "pagination": {
       "offset": 20,
       "limit": 10,
       "total": 48
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Cursor-Based Pagination**

   Best for: Real-time data, large datasets, or when clients need to fetch data incrementally.

   **Query Parameters:**

   - `cursor`: Opaque token pointing to a specific item
   - `limit`: Maximum number of items to return

   **Example:**

   ```http
   GET /v1/episodes?cursor=eyJpZCI6IjEwMCJ9&limit=10
   ```

   **Response Structure:**

   ```json
   {
     "episodes": [ ... ],
     "pagination": {
       "nextCursor": "eyJpZCI6IjExMCJ9",
       "previousCursor": "eyJpZCI6IjkwIn0=",
       "hasMore": true
     }
   }
   ```

#### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Default Values**

   - Always provide default values for pagination parameters
   - Typical defaults: `page=1`, `perPage=20` or `offset=0`, `limit=20`
   - Document default values in API specifications

2. **Maximum Values**

   - Set reasonable maximum values for `perPage` or `limit` parameters
   - Typical maximum: 100 items per request
   - Return a 400 Bad Request if clients exceed the maximum

3. **Response Metadata**

   - Include pagination metadata in every paginated response
   - Provide total counts when feasible
   - Include links to next/previous pages or cursors

4. **Hypermedia Links**

   - Consider including hypermedia links for navigation:

   ```json
   {
     "stations": [ ... ],
     "pagination": {
       "page": 2,
       "perPage": 10,
       "totalPages": 5,
       "links": {
         "first": "/v1/stations?page=1&perPage=10",
         "prev": "/v1/stations?page=1&perPage=10",
         "next": "/v1/stations?page=3&perPage=10",
         "last": "/v1/stations?page=5&perPage=10"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Response Headers**

   - Consider using standard pagination-related headers:
     - `X-Total-Count`: Total number of items
     - `Link`: Navigation links with rel=next, prev, first, last

6. **Consistency**
   - Use consistent pagination mechanisms across similar resources
   - Document the pagination approach for each resource
   - Be consistent with parameter naming conventions

#### Handling Edge Cases

- **Empty Results**: Return a 200 OK with an empty array and appropriate pagination metadata
- **Invalid Parameters**: Return a 400 Bad Request with error details
- **Out-of-Range**: Return the last available page if page number exceeds available pages

By following these pagination guidelines, JK Radio APIs will provide predictable and efficient
access to large datasets, improving both API performance and client experience.

### Filtering and Sorting

Effective filtering and sorting mechanisms are essential for allowing API consumers to retrieve
precisely the data they need, enhancing both performance and usability. JK Radio APIs should
implement consistent approaches to these features.

#### Filtering

Filtering allows clients to request only the data that matches specific criteria, reducing response
size and improving performance.

**Basic Filtering**:

- Use query parameters for filtering resources
- Use consistent naming conventions for filter parameters
- Filter parameters should use the same name as the field they filter

**Example**:

```http
GET /stations?genre=rock&country=canada
```

**Advanced Filtering**:

For more complex filtering needs, implement a standardized query syntax:

- Use a consistent operator syntax for comparisons
- Support logical operators for combining filters
- Standardize syntax for range and list operations

**Recommended Filter Operators**:

| Operator | Description              | Example                    |
| -------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| eq       | Equal to                 | `field=eq:value`           |
| neq      | Not equal to             | `field=neq:value`          |
| gt       | Greater than             | `listeners=gt:1000`        |
| gte      | Greater than or equal to | `listeners=gte:1000`       |
| lt       | Less than                | `listeners=lt:5000`        |
| lte      | Less than or equal to    | `listeners=lte:5000`       |
| in       | In a list                | `genre=in:rock,jazz,blues` |
| nin      | Not in a list            | `genre=nin:country,pop`    |
| like     | Pattern matching         | `name=like:radio*`         |

**Example of Advanced Filtering**:

```http
GET /broadcasts?date=gte:2023-01-01&listeners=gt:1000
```

#### Sorting

Sorting allows clients to specify the order in which resources are returned.

**Basic Sorting**:

- Use a dedicated `sort` query parameter
- Allow for both ascending and descending order
- Use a consistent prefix for indicating sort direction (e.g., `-` for descending)

**Example**:

```http
GET /stations?sort=name         // Sort by name ascending
GET /stations?sort=-listeners   // Sort by listeners descending
```

**Multiple Sort Criteria**:

- Support comma-separated list of fields for multi-field sorting
- Apply sorts in the order specified

**Example**:

```http
GET /stations?sort=country,-listeners   // Sort by country ascending, then by listeners descending
```

#### Best Practices

1. **Documentation**: Clearly document all supported filter and sort parameters
2. **Performance**: For large datasets, consider indexing commonly filtered and sorted fields
3. **Limitations**: Set reasonable limits on filter complexity to prevent performance issues
4. **Validation**: Validate all filter and sort parameters and return clear error messages for
   invalid inputs
5. **Default Behavior**: Specify default sort order when none is provided
6. **Case Sensitivity**: Be consistent with case sensitivity in filter operations
7. **Special Characters**: Properly handle special characters in filter values (URL encoding)
8. **Fallbacks**: Provide fallback behavior when sorting by nonexistent fields

### Error Handling

Proper error handling is critical for API usability, security, and maintainability. JK Radio APIs
should follow these standards for consistent error handling:

#### HTTP Status Codes

Use standard HTTP status codes to communicate the status of API requests. The following categories
should be used:

- **1XX – Informational**: Protocol state and state of the original request
- **2XX – Success**: Indicates the request was successful, fulfilled, or accepted
- **3XX – Redirection**: Indicates status of the resource or endpoint; useful in subdomains or when
  moving resources
- **4XX – Client Error**: Indicates client-side errors such as malformed requests or invalid
  parameters
- **5XX – Server Error**: Indicates server-side errors (not client issues)

#### Commonly Used Status Codes

| Code | Status                | Description                    | Usage                                        |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| 200  | OK                    | Request succeeded              | Successful GET, PUT, or DELETE with response |
| 201  | Created               | Resource created               | Successful POST that creates a resource      |
| 204  | No Content            | Request succeeded, no content  | Successful DELETE or PUT with no response    |
| 304  | Not Modified          | Resource hasn't changed        | Conditional GET with matching ETag           |
| 400  | Bad Request           | Malformed request syntax       | Missing parameters, validation errors        |
| 401  | Unauthorized          | Authentication required        | Missing or invalid credentials               |
| 403  | Forbidden             | Access not permitted           | Valid auth but insufficient permissions      |
| 404  | Not Found             | Resource does not exist        | Requested resource doesn't exist             |
| 405  | Method Not Allowed    | HTTP method not allowed        | Method not supported for this resource       |
| 409  | Conflict              | Request conflicts with state   | Concurrent updates, duplicate resource       |
| 429  | Too Many Requests     | Rate limit exceeded            | Too many requests in a given timeframe       |
| 500  | Internal Server Error | Server error                   | Unexpected server-side issues                |
| 503  | Service Unavailable   | Server temporarily unavailable | Maintenance or overload                      |

#### Error Response Format

All error responses should use a consistent JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "The requested station does not exist",
    "details": "Station ID 'kjr9' not found in the system",
    "requestId": "req-12345-abcd-6789",
    "timestamp": "2025-05-26T14:30:00Z",
    "path": "/v1/stations/kjr9",
    "help": "https://api.jkradio.com/docs/errors#resource-not-found"
  }
}
```

Key components of an error response:

1. **HTTP Status Code**: Include the appropriate HTTP status code in the response header
2. **Error Code**: A machine-readable string uniquely identifying the error type
3. **Message**: A human-readable message describing the error
4. **Details**: Additional context about the error (optional)
5. **Request ID**: A unique identifier for tracking the request in logs
6. **Timestamp**: When the error occurred
7. **Path**: The requested API endpoint
8. **Help**: Link to documentation with more information about the error (optional)

#### Error Handling Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Provide specific error messages that help the client understand and fix the issue
- **Abstract Internal Details**: Never expose implementation details, stack traces, or sensitive
  information
- **Validation Errors**: For validation errors, provide details about each invalid field:

  ```json
  {
    "error": {
      "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
      "message": "The request contains invalid parameters",
      "requestId": "req-12345-abcd-6789",
      "timestamp": "2025-05-26T14:30:00Z",
      "validationErrors": [
        {
          "field": "name",
          "message": "Station name is required"
        },
        {
          "field": "frequency",
          "message": "Frequency must be between 87.5 and 108.0 MHz"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

- **Log All Errors**: Log all errors with appropriate context and severity for monitoring and
  debugging
- **No Error Leakage**: Never return raw error messages from backend systems or databases
- **Handle Rate Limiting**: When rate limits are exceeded, return a 429 status code with:

  - `X-RateLimit-Limit` header: Maximum requests per time window
  - `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header: Number of requests left in the current window
  - `X-RateLimit-Reset` header: Unix timestamp when the rate limit resets
  - Include retry information in the response body

- **Language Localization**: Support error messages in multiple languages based on the
  `Accept-Language` header

Following these error handling standards ensures that API consumers can reliably interpret and
respond to errors, leading to better integration experiences and reduced support requests.

### Data Validation

Proper data validation is essential for ensuring API security, reliability, and usability. JK Radio
APIs should implement comprehensive validation for both request and response data according to these
guidelines:

#### Request Validation Principles

1. **Validate All Input**: Validate all client-provided input regardless of source (URL paths, query
   parameters, headers, and request bodies)

2. **Complete Validation Before Processing**: Perform all validation checks before processing the
   request to avoid partial processing of invalid data

3. **Appropriate Error Messages**: Return clear validation error messages that help clients fix the
   issue without revealing sensitive implementation details

4. **Validation Layers**:
   - Implement both structural validation (data types, formats)
   - Implement semantic validation (business rules, relationships)

#### Validation Standards

- **Content Type**: Validate Content-Type headers match the actual request body format
- **Required Fields**: Clearly document and validate required fields
- **Data Types**: Validate field data types (string, number, boolean, etc.)
- **Field Lengths**: Enforce minimum and maximum lengths for string fields
- **Value Ranges**: Enforce allowable value ranges for numeric fields
- **Formats**: Validate special formats like emails, URLs, dates, and phone numbers
- **Patterns**: Use regular expressions to validate formatted string fields
- **Enumerations**: Restrict values to defined enumerations where appropriate
- **Relationships**: Validate related entities exist when referenced by ID
- **Idempotency**: Validate idempotency tokens when provided

#### Validation Response Format

When validation fails, return a 400 Bad Request status code with a standardized error response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "The request contains invalid parameters",
    "validationErrors": [
      {
        "field": "name",
        "message": "Station name is required",
        "code": "REQUIRED_FIELD"
      },
      {
        "field": "frequency",
        "message": "Frequency must be between 87.5 and 108.0 MHz",
        "code": "RANGE_VIOLATION",
        "details": {
          "min": 87.5,
          "max": 108.0,
          "actual": 150.25
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Each validation error should include:

- The field name that failed validation
- A descriptive error message
- A validation error code
- Additional context when helpful

#### Complex Validation Scenarios

For more complex validation scenarios:

1. **Cross-Field Validation**: Validate dependencies or relationships between fields

   - Example: "end_date must be after start_date"

2. **Conditional Validation**: Apply rules based on the presence or value of other fields

   - Example: "if type is 'recurring', then frequency is required"

3. **Bulk Operations**: When validating bulk operations, validate all items before processing and
   return all errors at once

4. **Nested Resource Validation**: For nested resources, provide the full field path in errors
   - Example: "programs[0].episodes[2].title is required"

#### Response Validation

Validate API responses against their schema definitions before sending to clients:

1. **Schema Compliance**: Ensure all responses conform to their documented schemas
2. **Sensitive Data**: Verify no sensitive data is accidentally included in responses
3. **Content-Type**: Set correct Content-Type headers matching the response format

#### Testing and Tooling

Implement comprehensive validation testing:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test validation rules with both valid and invalid data
2. **Fuzz Testing**: Use fuzz testing to identify edge cases and vulnerabilities
3. **Schema Validation**: Use JSON Schema or OpenAPI specifications to define and validate data
4. **Automation**: Integrate validation testing into CI/CD processes

By following these data validation standards, JK Radio APIs will be more secure, reliable, and
provide a better developer experience through clear, actionable error messages.

## Security Requirements

### Authentication and Authorization

Secure authentication and authorization are foundational to protecting API resources. JK Radio APIs
must implement robust mechanisms to verify identities and control access based on these guidelines:

#### Authentication Methods

JK Radio APIs should implement one or more of these standard authentication methods based on the
API's security requirements and audience:

1. **OAuth 2.0** (Recommended for most APIs)

   - Use for APIs accessed by third-party applications on behalf of users
   - Support standard flows:
     - Authorization Code flow for web applications
     - PKCE for mobile/native applications
     - Client Credentials flow for service-to-service communication
   - Include standard OAuth 2.0 scopes for granular access control

2. **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**

   - Use for stateless authentication with signed tokens
   - Validate token signature, expiry, and claims
   - Include standard claims:
     - `iss` (issuer)
     - `sub` (subject)
     - `exp` (expiration time)
     - `iat` (issued at)
     - `aud` (audience)
   - Add custom claims for JK Radio-specific information and permissions

3. **API Keys**

   - Use for simpler public or partner APIs with lower security requirements
   - Require API keys to be sent in HTTP headers (not in URLs)
   - Generate strong, random keys with sufficient entropy
   - Implement key rotation and revocation processes

4. **Mutual TLS**
   - Use for highly secure service-to-service communication
   - Require valid client certificates along with server certificates
   - Implement certificate validation and revocation checking

#### Authorization Principles

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**

   - Grant only the minimum permissions necessary for the intended function
   - Scope access tokens to specific resources and operations

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

   - Define clear roles with specific permissions
   - Common roles include: Admin, Editor, Viewer, and custom roles
   - Store roles and permissions centrally for consistent enforcement

3. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**

   - For more complex scenarios, use attributes of users, resources, and environment
   - Define policies combining multiple attributes

4. **Resource Ownership**
   - Validate that users can only access resources they own or have been granted access to
   - Implement resource-level permissions

#### Implementation Standards

1. **Request Authentication**

   - Require authentication for all non-public endpoints
   - Accept credentials in standard locations:
     - Authentication header (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`)
     - API keys in custom headers (`X-API-Key: <api-key>`)
   - Never accept credentials in URL parameters

2. **Token Handling**

   - Set appropriate token expiration times
   - Implement token refresh mechanisms
   - Store tokens securely (no client-side storage of sensitive tokens)
   - Validate all tokens on every request

3. **Access Control Enforcement**

   - Implement authorization checks at the API gateway level when possible
   - Apply fine-grained access control at the resource level
   - Validate both authentication and authorization for every request
   - Return 401 (Unauthorized) for invalid/missing credentials
   - Return 403 (Forbidden) for insufficient permissions

4. **Session Management**
   - Use secure, HTTP-only cookies for web applications when appropriate
   - Implement session timeout and renewal processes
   - Allow users to view and terminate active sessions
   - Track and log all session activities

#### Security Headers

Implement standard security headers:

- `Strict-Transport-Security`: Enforce HTTPS connections
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`: Prevent MIME type sniffing
- `Content-Security-Policy`: Restrict resource loading
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`: Prevent clickjacking attacks
- `Cache-Control: no-store`: Prevent caching of sensitive information

#### Authentication and Authorization Testing

Regularly test authentication and authorization mechanisms:

1. **Vulnerability Testing**: Check for common vulnerabilities like:

   - Broken authentication flows
   - Missing authorization checks
   - Token leakage or manipulation
   - Session fixation

2. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular penetration testing focusing on:
   - Authentication bypass techniques
   - Privilege escalation
   - Token exploitation
   - Session hijacking

By following these authentication and authorization guidelines, JK Radio APIs will maintain a strong
security posture while providing appropriate access to authorized users and applications.

### Transport Security

Secure transport is essential for protecting API communications from interception, eavesdropping,
and manipulation. JK Radio APIs must adhere to these transport security standards:

#### HTTPS Requirements

- **HTTPS Only**: All JK Radio APIs must use HTTPS (TLS) for all endpoints, including test and
  development environments. HTTP requests should be rejected or permanently redirected to HTTPS.

- **Minimum TLS Version**: Support only TLS 1.2 or higher. Disable support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1, as
  well as all SSL versions, due to known vulnerabilities.

- **Strong Cipher Suites**: Configure servers to use only strong cipher suites with perfect forward
  secrecy (PFS). Prefer ECDHE over RSA key exchange when possible.

- **Secure Certificate Management**:
  - Use certificates from trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs)
  - Implement proper certificate validation on both client and server sides
  - Monitor certificate expiration dates and renew before expiry
  - Use certificates with a minimum key length of 2048 bits for RSA or 256 bits for ECC
  - Include proper Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for all domain variations

#### HTTPS Headers and Configurations

- **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**:

  - Implement HSTS with a minimum age of one year (31536000 seconds)
  - Include the `includeSubDomains` directive for complete domain protection
  - Consider preloading domains in browser HSTS lists for maximum security

  Example header:

  ```http
  Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
  ```

- **Certificate Transparency**: Ensure certificates are logged in Certificate Transparency logs and
  consider implementing Expect-CT headers.

- **Public Key Pinning**: Consider HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) for high-security APIs, but
  implement with caution due to operational complexity.

- **OCSP Stapling**: Enable OCSP stapling to efficiently verify certificate revocation status.

#### TLS Best Practices

1. **Regular Security Scans**: Conduct regular scans of API endpoints using tools like SSL Labs or
   testssl.sh to verify proper TLS configuration.

2. **Proper Hostname Verification**: Ensure proper hostname verification is implemented in API
   clients to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

3. **TLS Session Resumption**: Enable TLS session resumption to improve performance while
   maintaining security.

4. **Disable Insecure Features**:

   - Disable TLS compression (CRIME attack mitigation)
   - Disable TLS renegotiation when possible, or at least enforce secure renegotiation
   - Disable weak Diffie-Hellman parameters (minimum 2048-bit)
   - Avoid weak signature algorithms like MD5 and SHA-1

5. **Keep Updated**: Regularly update TLS libraries and server software to include security patches.

#### Client Requirements

- **Certificate Validation**: API clients must validate server certificates properly:

  - Verify the certificate chain to a trusted root CA
  - Check expiration dates
  - Validate hostname against certificate
  - Check revocation status (CRL or OCSP)

- **Cipher Suite Support**: Clients should support modern cipher suites that are compatible with the
  server configuration.

- **Secure TLS Libraries**: Use up-to-date TLS libraries that implement security best practices.

#### Monitoring and Incident Response

- **TLS Configuration Monitoring**: Regularly monitor TLS configurations for security issues.

- **Certificate Expiry Monitoring**: Implement automated monitoring for certificate expiration.

- **Incident Response**: Have a clear incident response plan for TLS-related security issues.

By adhering to these transport security guidelines, JK Radio ensures that all API communications
remain secure, protecting both the organization and its users from potential threats.

### API Keys and Token Management

Proper management of API keys and tokens is critical for maintaining security while providing
convenient access to APIs. JK Radio APIs should follow these standards for key and token management:

#### API Key Standards

1. **Key Generation**:

   - Generate cryptographically strong, random API keys with sufficient entropy
   - Minimum length of 32 bytes (256 bits) encoded in URL-safe base64 or hex
   - Include a key identifier prefix to distinguish different API key types
   - Consider including a checksum digit for basic integrity checking

2. **Key Distribution**:

   - Distribute API keys securely, preferably through an authenticated developer portal
   - Display keys only once during creation and never log or store unencrypted keys
   - Require re-authentication for key regeneration or viewing

3. **Key Storage**:

   - Store only hashed versions of API keys using a strong algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2)
   - Associate metadata with keys (owner, creation date, permissions, usage limits)
   - Implement key-value lookup for efficient validation

4. **Key Transmission**:

   - Require API keys to be sent in headers (preferred) or request body
   - Never accept API keys in URL query parameters due to security risks
   - Standard header format: `X-API-Key: <api-key>`

5. **Key Lifecycle Management**:
   - Implement key expiration dates for all API keys
   - Allow for manual key revocation and regeneration
   - Automatically deactivate keys that have not been used for extended periods
   - Track key usage for auditing and anomaly detection

#### Access Token Standards

1. **Token Types**:

   - Access Tokens: Short-lived tokens for API access
   - Refresh Tokens: Long-lived tokens used only to obtain new access tokens
   - ID Tokens: Contain user identity information (for OpenID Connect)

2. **Token Format**:

   - Use JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) with appropriate claims
   - Include standard claims: `iss`, `sub`, `exp`, `iat`, `aud`
   - Add custom claims for roles, permissions, and contextual information
   - Sign tokens using strong algorithms (RS256, ES256)
   - Consider token encryption for highly sensitive scenarios

3. **Token Security**:

   - Set appropriate expiration times:
     - Access tokens: 15-60 minutes
     - Refresh tokens: 7-30 days
   - Implement token revocation endpoints and maintain revocation lists
   - Use secure cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite) for browser contexts
   - Store tokens securely on clients (e.g., secure storage on mobile devices)

4. **Token Validation**:
   - Validate token signatures on every request
   - Verify token has not expired or been revoked
   - Validate audience and issuer claims

#### Multi-Environment Management

- **Environment Separation**: Use different keys and tokens for development, testing, and production
- **Key Rotation**: Implement regular key rotation schedules
- **Graceful Transitions**: Support overlapping validity periods during key/token rotation

#### Rate Limiting and Throttling

- **Per-Key Limits**: Implement rate limits based on API key or token
- **Tiered Access**: Define different rate limits based on subscription levels
- **Quota Management**: Track and enforce usage quotas per key
- **Abuse Prevention**: Implement automatic key suspension for detected abuse

#### Security Monitoring

- **Unusual Activity Detection**: Monitor and alert on unusual patterns of API key/token usage
- **Logging**: Log all key/token creation, usage, and revocation events
- **Analytics**: Track API key usage for business and security analytics

#### Developer Experience

- **Self-Service Portal**: Provide a portal for developers to manage their API keys
- **Documentation**: Clearly document key/token usage requirements and security practices
- **Trial Access**: Enable easy trial access to APIs with automatically expiring keys
- **Key Naming**: Allow developers to name their keys for easier management

#### Emergency Response

- **Revocation Mechanism**: Implement emergency revocation capabilities for security incidents
- **Bulk Actions**: Support bulk revocation of keys/tokens when needed
- **Communication Plan**: Have a communication plan for notifying affected developers

By following these API key and token management standards, JK Radio can maintain high security
standards while providing a positive developer experience for API consumers.

### Data Protection

Protecting sensitive data throughout its lifecycle is a critical aspect of API security. JK Radio
APIs must implement comprehensive data protection measures according to these guidelines:

#### Data Classification

Categorize all data processed by APIs according to sensitivity levels:

1. **Public Data**: Information that can be freely distributed (e.g., public station listings)
2. **Internal Data**: Non-sensitive business information for internal use (e.g., broadcast
   schedules)
3. **Confidential Data**: Business data requiring protection (e.g., unreleased program information)
4. **Restricted Data**: Highly sensitive information (e.g., personal data, authentication
   credentials)

Apply security controls appropriate to each classification level, with stricter measures for higher
sensitivity levels.

#### Personal Data Protection

For APIs handling personal data, implement these protections:

1. **Privacy by Design**:

   - Collect only necessary personal data for the intended purpose
   - Implement data minimization principles by default
   - Design APIs to support right to access, correction, and deletion requests

2. **Regulatory Compliance**:

   - Ensure compliance with applicable privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, PIPEDA)
   - Document data processing purposes and legal bases
   - Provide mechanisms for consent management when required
   - Support data portability requirements

3. **User Consent and Control**:
   - Provide clear, user-friendly consent mechanisms before processing personal data
   - Allow users to modify or withdraw consent for specific data uses
   - Design APIs to respect user preferences and privacy settings

#### Data Protection in Transit

Beyond basic TLS requirements:

1. **Field-Level Encryption**:

   - Consider end-to-end encryption for highly sensitive fields
   - Use client-side encryption when appropriate to protect data from server access

2. **Secure Request/Response Handling**:
   - Implement proper CORS policies to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests
   - Use secure headers to prevent data leakage (e.g., Referrer-Policy, Content-Security-Policy)
   - Set appropriate Cache-Control headers to prevent caching of sensitive data

#### Data Protection at Rest

1. **Encryption Requirements**:

   - Encrypt sensitive data before storage using industry-standard algorithms
   - Use strong encryption keys (minimum AES-256 for symmetric, RSA-2048 or ECC-256 for asymmetric)
   - Implement proper key management with regular key rotation

2. **Database Security**:
   - Apply principle of least privilege to database access
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Implement row-level security for multi-tenant data
   - Consider database-level encryption for sensitive fields

#### Data Masking and Anonymization

1. **Data Masking Techniques**:

   - Mask sensitive data in API responses when full values aren't needed
   - Use consistent masking patterns (e.g., show only last 4 digits of payment cards)
   - Implement role-based masking levels (different users see different masking levels)

2. **Anonymization and Pseudonymization**:
   - Anonymize data for analytics and testing purposes
   - Use pseudonymization techniques to maintain utility while protecting identities
   - Ensure anonymized data cannot be re-identified through combination with other data

#### Secure Logging and Monitoring

1. **Log Security**:

   - Never log sensitive data such as credentials, tokens, or personal information
   - Implement log redaction for accidentally included sensitive information
   - Protect access to logs containing potentially sensitive information
   - Set appropriate log retention periods

2. **Security Monitoring**:
   - Monitor for suspicious data access patterns
   - Implement alerts for potential data breaches or leaks
   - Conduct regular data access audits

#### Data Retention and Disposal

1. **Retention Policies**:

   - Define and enforce data retention periods for different data types
   - Implement automated processes for data archival and deletion
   - Maintain retention policy metadata with stored data

2. **Secure Disposal**:
   - Implement secure data deletion procedures
   - Ensure complete removal of data across all systems and backups when required
   - Provide data deletion verification and certificates when needed

#### Incident Response

1. **Data Breach Response**:

   - Develop and maintain a data breach response plan
   - Define notification procedures for affected users and regulatory authorities
   - Conduct regular tests of the response plan

2. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - Maintain comprehensive documentation of all data protection measures
   - Create processes for regulatory reporting requirements
   - Conduct post-incident reviews to improve data protection measures

By implementing these data protection guidelines, JK Radio APIs will safeguard sensitive
information, maintain user trust, and comply with regulatory requirements while still providing
valuable functionality.

### Rate Limiting and Throttling

Rate limiting and throttling are essential mechanisms for protecting APIs from excessive use and
ensuring fair resource allocation among consumers. JK Radio APIs must implement rate limiting and
throttling according to these guidelines:

#### Rate Limiting Fundamentals

1. **Purpose and Benefits**:

   - Protect API infrastructure from excessive load
   - Prevent performance degradation affecting all users
   - Ensure fair resource allocation among consumers
   - Mitigate abuse, denial of service attacks, and scraping
   - Support differentiated service tiers and monetization

2. **Rate Limit Dimensions**:

   - **Requests per time window**: Limit on the number of requests in a defined time period
   - **Concurrent requests**: Limit on simultaneous in-flight requests
   - **Bandwidth consumption**: Limit on data transfer volume
   - **Resource consumption**: Limit based on computational cost of requests

3. **Limit Scopes**:
   - **Global limits**: Applied across the entire API
   - **Endpoint-specific limits**: Different limits for different endpoints
   - **Method-specific limits**: Different limits for different HTTP methods
   - **Resource-specific limits**: Limits applied to specific resources
   - **User-specific limits**: Limits based on user identity or tier

#### Rate Limit Implementation

1. **Default Rate Limits**:

   | API Type      | Anonymous Users  | Authenticated Users  | Premium Tier         |
   | ------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
   | Public APIs   | 60 requests/hour | 1,000 requests/hour  | 10,000 requests/hour |
   | Partner APIs  | Not applicable   | 5,000 requests/hour  | 50,000 requests/hour |
   | Internal APIs | Not applicable   | 10,000 requests/hour | Not applicable       |

2. **Endpoint-Specific Considerations**:

   - **Read operations**: Higher limits than write operations
   - **Search endpoints**: Lower limits due to resource intensity
   - **Bulk operations**: Special limits based on item count
   - **Critical infrastructure**: Stricter limits to protect core functionality

3. **Time Window Types**:

   - **Fixed window**: Count resets at specific times (hour/day boundaries)
   - **Rolling window**: Sliding time period (last 60 minutes)
   - **Token bucket**: Accumulating quota with steady replenishment rate

   JK Radio standardizes on rolling windows for most rate limits.

#### Client Communication

1. **HTTP Headers for Rate Limits**:

   - Use standard HTTP headers to communicate limits and usage:
     - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed in the period
     - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in the current period
     - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the limit will reset (Unix timestamp)

   ```http
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json
   X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
   X-RateLimit-Remaining: 950
   X-RateLimit-Reset: 1614556800
   ```

2. **Rate Limit Exceeded Response**:

   - Return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) status code
   - Include `Retry-After` header with seconds until retry is allowed
   - Provide clear error message with rate limit details

   ```http
   HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
   Content-Type: application/json
   Retry-After: 60

   {
     "error": {
       "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
       "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 60 seconds.",
       "details": {
         "limit": 1000,
         "resetAt": "2025-05-26T14:30:00Z",
         "retryAfter": 60
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - Clearly document all rate limits in API documentation
   - Explain rate limit tiers and upgrade options
   - Provide best practices for clients to handle rate limiting
   - Include sample code for rate limit handling

#### Throttling Strategies

1. **Graduated Throttling**:

   - Implement progressively restrictive measures as load increases
   - Define multiple thresholds with increasing restrictions
   - Examples:
     - Level 1: Normal operation
     - Level 2: Reject low-priority requests
     - Level 3: Reject all non-essential requests
     - Level 4: Serve only cached responses

2. **Client-Specific Throttling**:

   - Apply throttling based on client behavior and history
   - Reduce limits for clients with error-prone request patterns
   - Implement temporary restrictions for abusive behavior
   - Provide feedback mechanism for clients to request limit reviews

3. **Resource-Based Throttling**:
   - Adjust limits based on current system resource utilization
   - Reduce allowed throughput during peak load periods
   - Implement automatic scaling before throttling when possible
   - Prioritize critical operations during high load

#### Implementation Considerations

1. **Rate Limit Storage**:

   - Use distributed cache (Redis, Memcached) for rate limit counters
   - Ensure high availability of rate limiting infrastructure
   - Implement graceful degradation if rate limit service is unavailable
   - Consider background synchronization for counter persistence

2. **Rate Limit Identification**:

   - Use consistent client identification methods:
     - API key for authenticated requests
     - IP address for anonymous requests (with proxy considerations)
     - Combination of identifiers for enhanced precision

3. **Burst Handling**:

   - Allow short bursts of traffic exceeding steady-state limits
   - Implement leaky bucket or token bucket algorithms
   - Configure burst parameters based on API capacity
   - Document burst allowances in API specifications

4. **Service Tiers**:
   - Implement different rate limits based on service tier
   - Support upgrade paths between tiers
   - Consider specialized limits for enterprise customers
   - Provide self-service tools for tier management

#### Monitoring and Management

1. **Rate Limit Monitoring**:

   - Track rate limit usage patterns across clients
   - Monitor rate limit exceeded events
   - Alert on unusual patterns or abuse
   - Analyze trends to inform limit adjustments

2. **Client Notification**:

   - Provide proactive notification when approaching limits

   - Enable customer service to resolve limit-related issues
   - Log all limit adjustments for audit purposes

By implementing these rate limiting and throttling standards, JK Radio will protect its API
infrastructure while providing fair access to all consumers and supporting differentiated service
tiers.

### Caching Strategies

Effective caching is essential for optimizing API performance, reducing latency, and minimizing
resource consumption. JK Radio APIs should implement caching following these guidelines:

#### HTTP Caching Standards

1. **Cache Control Headers**:

   - Implement standard HTTP cache control headers:
     - `Cache-Control`: Primary directive for controlling caching behavior
     - `ETag`: Entity tag for conditional requests
     - `Last-Modified`: Resource modification timestamp
     - `Expires`: Legacy absolute expiration time
   - Use appropriate Cache-Control directives:
     - `max-age`: Duration in seconds the response can be cached
     - `s-maxage`: Duration for shared caches (CDNs, proxies)
     - `no-cache`: Require validation before using cached response
     - `no-store`: Prohibit caching of sensitive responses
     - `private`: Allow browser caching but not intermediate caches
     - `public`: Allow caching by all caches

2. **Cache Duration Guidelines**:

   | Resource Type            | Recommended Cache Duration | Cache-Control Example                 |
   | ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
   | Static reference data    | 1 hour to 24 hours         | `Cache-Control: max-age=3600, public` |
   | Frequently changing data | 1 to 5 minutes             | `Cache-Control: max-age=60, public`   |
   | User-specific data       | 1 to 5 minutes             | `Cache-Control: max-age=300, private` |
   | Sensitive data           | No caching                 | `Cache-Control: no-store`             |
   | Rapidly changing data    | Validation only            | `Cache-Control: no-cache`             |

3. **Conditional Requests**:
   - Support conditional requests with validators:
     - `If-Modified-Since`: Used with `Last-Modified` header
     - `If-None-Match`: Used with `ETag` header
   - Return 304 Not Modified when resource hasn't changed
   - Implement strong ETags for exact matching
   - Generate ETags based on content hash or version identifiers

#### Application-Level Caching

1. **Server-Side Caching Layers**:

   - **API Gateway Cache**: Cache common responses at the API gateway
   - **Application Cache**: Cache processed data and rendered responses
   - **Database Query Cache**: Cache frequent or expensive queries
   - **Object Cache**: Cache deserialized business objects

2. **Recommended Caching Technologies**:

   - In-memory caches: Redis, Memcached
   - Distributed caches: Redis Cluster, Hazelcast
   - Local caches: Caffeine, Guava Cache, LRU Cache
   - CDNs: For public, cacheable API responses

3. **Cache Key Design**:
   - Design cache keys to be unique and deterministic
   - Include all relevant request parameters in cache keys
   - Handle variations in content negotiation (format, language)
   - Consider version information in cache keys

#### Caching Implementation Patterns

1. **Cache-Aside Pattern**:

   - Check cache before processing request
   - Update cache after retrieving from data source
   - Implement consistent cache update and invalidation

   ```pseudocode
   function getData(key):
     data = cache.get(key)
     if data is null:
       data = database.query(key)
       cache.put(key, data, expiration)
     return data
   ```

2. **Cache Invalidation Strategies**:

   - **Time-Based Expiration**: Set appropriate TTL based on data volatility
   - **Event-Based Invalidation**: Invalidate on write operations
   - **Version-Based Invalidation**: Use version numbers for cache entries
   - **Bulk Invalidation**: Clear related cache entries when data changes

3. **Write-Through Caching**:

   - Update cache and database in same transaction
   - Ensure cache consistency with data store
   - Use for write-heavy applications with read-after-write scenarios

4. **Refresh Ahead Pattern**:
   - Proactively refresh cache before expiration
   - Maintain cache warmth for critical data
   - Avoid cache stampedes during mass expiration

#### Caching Considerations by Resource Type

1. **Collection Resources**:

   - Cache paginated collections with short TTL
   - Consider different cache durations for different query parameters
   - Invalidate collection caches when items are added/modified/removed

2. **Individual Resources**:

   - Cache with longer TTL than collections
   - Use resource-specific ETags based on modification time or version
   - Invalidate when the resource is updated or deleted

3. **Aggregated or Computed Resources**:

   - Cache expensive computed resources longer
   - Update cache when underlying data changes
   - Consider background refresh for complex calculations

4. **User-Specific Resources**:
   - Use `private` cache directive for user-specific data
   - Include user identifier in cache keys
   - Implement shorter TTLs for frequently changing user data
   - Clear all user caches on logout or password change

#### Cache Management and Operations

1. **Cache Monitoring**:

   - Track cache hit/miss ratios
   - Monitor cache size and memory usage
   - Set up alerts for low hit rates or high eviction rates
   - Analyze cache effectiveness periodically

2. **Cache Warming**:

   - Implement cache warming for critical paths
   - Pre-populate caches after deployment or restart
   - Use staggered warming to prevent load spikes
   - Maintain redundant cache nodes when possible

3. **Cache Versioning**:

   - Include API version in cache keys
   - Update cache key generation when data structure changes
   - Consider cache namespace versioning for major releases

4. **Failure Handling**:
   - Implement graceful degradation when cache is unavailable
   - Fall back to direct data source access if cache fails
   - Log cache failures for investigation
   - Avoid cascading failures from cache issues

By implementing these caching strategies, JK Radio APIs will deliver faster response times, reduce
database load, and scale more efficiently to handle peak traffic demands.
